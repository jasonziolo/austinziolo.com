        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Breezeflight is the lightest and fastest dragon, with silver-white scales that seem to shimmer in the wind. His wings create air currents that carry sounds and messages throughout the entire lair, making him the perfect messenger.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Breezeflight was born from the first gust of wind that ever swept across the mountains. When ancient storms split the highest peaks, his egg was caught in a whirlwind and carried through the clouds for a thousand years before landing gently in Austin's lair. As he hatched, the very air around him began to sing, and he learned to understand the language of the winds. His silver-white scales formed from crystallized air currents, making him lighter than any other dragon. Breezeflight's purpose became clear when he discovered he could carry messages on the wind, connecting all corners of the lair with his gentle whispers.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Breezeflight's natural enemies are dragons of heavy earth and stone, like Earthheart, who cannot keep up with his swift movements. However, they respect each other's domains. He also clashes occasionally with Stormwing, as both command different aspects of the sky - Breezeflight prefers gentle breezes while Stormwing brings powerful storms. Despite this, they work together to maintain the lair's atmosphere. Breezeflight's closest friends are Radiant and Crystalwing, who appreciate his light touch and gentle nature. He often carries messages between the dragons, serving as the lair's primary communicator. His friendship with Vineclaw is also strong, as he helps pollinate her gardens and spread seeds throughout the lair with his air currents.</p>

        <p class="element">Unique Power: Breezeflight can create air currents that carry sounds and messages throughout the entire lair, making him the perfect messenger.</p>
