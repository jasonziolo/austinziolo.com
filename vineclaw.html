        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Vineclaw has green scales covered in living moss and flowers. Her claws can instantly grow plants. Her unique power allows her to create living gardens anywhere in the lair, growing food-bearing plants that never need water or sunlight.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Vineclaw was born from the first seed that ever took root in the deepest, most fertile earth. Her egg was discovered growing like a massive seed pod in the center of an ancient grove, with vines and flowers wrapping around it in a protective embrace. When she hatched, life itself burst forth - every step she took caused flowers to bloom, and every touch of her claws made trees and plants spring from the ground. Her scales formed from living plant matter, constantly growing and changing with the seasons. Vineclaw's connection to all living things makes her the heart of the lair's ecosystem, ensuring that no matter what happens, life will always flourish. She learned to grow food-bearing plants that sustain all the dragons, making her beloved by everyone in the lair.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Vineclaw's natural enemies are dragons of fire and destruction. Flamethorn's flames can wither her plants, and Metalbeak's forge heat makes her uncomfortable. However, they have learned to work together, with Vineclaw creating cooling plant areas around the forge. Her closest friends are Breezeflight, who helps pollinate her gardens and spread seeds throughout the lair. She also has a special bond with Earthheart, as they work together to create beautiful garden grottos and plant-covered stone formations. Vineclaw's friendship with Aquaris is strong, as water and nature work in perfect harmony. She is beloved by all the dragons for her ability to provide food and create beautiful, life-filled spaces throughout the lair.</p>
