        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Radiant has golden scales that shine like the sun. Her wings create prismatic rainbows when they catch the light. Her unique power allows her to create solid light constructs - bridges, stairs, and walls made entirely of pure light that last for hours.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Radiant was born from the first ray of sunlight that ever pierced the darkness, when dawn first broke across the world. Her egg formed where that golden beam touched the earth, crystallizing into pure light energy that glowed for a thousand years before hatching. When she emerged, the entire lair was filled with warm, golden light, and her scales formed from solidified sunlight. Radiant learned early that she could shape light into solid forms, creating bridges, stairs, and structures that existed as pure radiance. Her ability to create light constructs makes her the lair's architect of illumination, building pathways and structures that glow with inner light. The prismatic rainbows from her wings bring beauty and joy wherever she goes.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Radiant's brilliant light can conflict with Shadowmaw's darkness, but they have learned to work together, with Radiant creating areas of light while respecting Shadowmaw's need for shadows. Her closest friends are Breezeflight and Crystalwing, who both appreciate her light and work with her to create beautiful displays. Radiant's friendship with Frostbite is unique - light and cold creating stunning prismatic effects when they work together. She also has a special bond with Vineclaw, as her light helps plants grow and her warmth creates perfect conditions for gardens. Despite her bright nature, Radiant is gentle and kind, using her light to guide and protect rather than to blind or harm. All dragons appreciate her warm presence and the beautiful light she brings to the lair.</p>
