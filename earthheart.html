        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Earthheart has armor-like brown and green scales that look like moss-covered stone. He moves slowly but with immense power. His unique power allows him to shape stone with his claws, creating new tunnels and rooms in the lair by simply touching the walls.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Earthheart was born from the first stone that ever formed in the depths of the earth, when the world's core first began to cool and crystallize. His egg was discovered deep within the heart of the largest mountain, encased in bedrock that had never seen the light of day. When he finally hatched after eons of patient waiting, the very ground shook with his awakening. His scales formed from the finest stone and earth, covered in living moss and lichen that connect him to all growing things. Earthheart learned early that the stone itself would respond to his touch, reshaping itself to his will. His mastery over earth and stone makes him the lair's architect and builder, constantly expanding and improving the underground home. His slow, deliberate movements reflect the patient nature of the earth itself.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Earthheart's grounding nature can conflict with Stormwing's lightning, but they work together with Stormwing powering the lair while Earthheart provides the structure. His closest friends are Metalbeak, as they work together to mine ores and create both stone and metal structures. Earthheart also has a strong bond with Vineclaw, as they create beautiful garden grottos and plant-covered stone formations together. His friendship with Frostbite is unique - stone and ice creating beautiful frozen caverns. Despite his heavy, slow nature, Earthheart can be surprisingly agile when needed, using his stone-shaping powers to create instant fortifications or pathways. All dragons respect his strength and stability, and he is the foundation upon which the lair is built.</p>
