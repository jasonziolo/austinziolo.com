        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Frostbite has crystalline blue-white scales that glitter like ice. Her breath creates beautiful ice sculptures. Her unique power allows her to freeze time in small areas, creating frozen moments that she can examine and then release, perfect for protecting treasures.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Frostbite was born from the first snowflake that ever fell, caught in a moment of perfect stillness at the peak of the world's highest mountain. Her egg formed when that single snowflake touched a crystal of pure ice, creating a living sculpture that existed outside of time itself. When she finally hatched after centuries of frozen incubation, time itself paused to witness her awakening. Frostbite's scales formed from crystallized ice that never melts, reflecting light in a thousand directions like a diamond. Her breath freezes the very air, creating intricate ice sculptures that capture moments in time. She discovered her power to freeze time when she accidentally stopped time around a beautiful flower she wanted to preserve forever. Since then, Frostbite has been the lair's guardian of precious treasures, using her time-freezing ability to protect what matters most.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Frostbite's natural enemies are dragons of fire and heat. Flamethorn's eternal flames can melt her ice, and Metalbeak's forge heat makes her uncomfortable. However, they have learned to coexist, with Frostbite creating cooling areas for the forge. Her closest friends are Aquaris, who shares her love of crystalline beauty and helps her create ice-and-water formations. She also gets along well with Crystalwing, as both appreciate the beauty of frozen and crystallized forms. Frostbite has a special bond with Earthheart, as they work together to create beautiful ice caves and frozen stone formations. Despite her cold nature, Frostbite is fiercely protective and loyal, using her time-freezing power to protect her friends when they're in danger. Her friendship with Radiant is unique, as they balance each other - light and cold creating beautiful displays together.</p>
