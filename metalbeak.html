        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Metalbeak has steel-gray scales that ring like bells when struck. His claws can cut through any material. His unique power allows him to reshape metal with his heat alone, crafting weapons and tools without ever needing a forge or hammer.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Metalbeak was born from the first strike of hammer on metal, when the ancient smiths first discovered the art of forging. His egg was found deep within a mountain of pure iron ore, heated by the earth's core and shaped by centuries of pressure. When he finally hatched, the sound of ringing metal echoed through the lair, and his scales formed from the finest steel. Metalbeak learned early that his body heat alone could soften and shape metal, making him the ultimate craftsman. His mastery over metal makes him the lair's builder and weapon-smith, creating tools and structures that last forever. The bell-like ringing of his scales is both a warning and a call to work, signaling to all that the forge is active.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Metalbeak's forge heat can make some dragons uncomfortable, particularly Frostbite and Vineclaw, who prefer cooler environments. However, they have learned to work together, with Metalbeak creating heat-resistant areas and the others helping to cool his forge when needed. His closest friend is Earthheart, as they work together to mine ores and shape both stone and metal into beautiful structures. Metalbeak also works closely with Stormwing, whose lightning powers his forge and helps with the most difficult metalworking. His friendship with Flamethorn is strong, as they both command fire and heat, though Metalbeak's is focused and controlled while Flamethorn's is wild and eternal. Metalbeak is respected by all dragons for his craftsmanship and his ability to create weapons and tools that help protect and enhance the lair.</p>
