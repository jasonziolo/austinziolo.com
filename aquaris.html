        <p class="element">Element: Water</p>
        <p class="measurements">Height: 22 feet | Wingspan: 38 feet | Weight: 7,500 pounds</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Aquaris has shimmering blue scales that ripple like ocean waves. Her tail can create whirlpools with a single flick. Her unique power allows her to breathe water that flows upward, creating waterfalls that defy gravity and fill the lair's pools from below.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Aquaris was born from the first drop of water that ever fell, when the primordial ocean first formed in the depths of the world. Her egg was discovered at the bottom of the deepest, most ancient sea, surrounded by currents that had flowed for millennia. When she finally hatched, water itself seemed to come alive, flowing in impossible directions and creating beautiful formations. Her scales formed from crystallized water that shimmers with every movement, reflecting light in a thousand different ways. Aquaris learned early that she could control water in ways that defied normal physics, making it flow upward and create waterfalls that go against gravity. Her mastery over water makes her the lair's primary source of fresh water and beautiful aquatic environments. The pools and waterfalls she creates are places of peace and beauty for all the dragons.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Aquaris's water can conduct Stormwing's lightning in unpredictable ways, but they have learned to work together, with Aquaris creating water features while Stormwing powers systems safely. Her water can also conflict with Flamethorn's fire, but careful management keeps both safe. Her closest friend is Vineclaw, as water and nature work in perfect harmony, with Aquaris providing the water that helps Vineclaw's gardens flourish. Aquaris also has a special bond with Frostbite, as they both create beautiful crystalline formations - one from water, one from ice. Her friendship with Crystalwing is strong, as they create beautiful displays together with water refracting light through crystals. Despite her flowing nature, Aquaris is steady and reliable, using her power to sustain life and create beautiful, peaceful spaces throughout the lair.</p>
