        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shadowmaw has scales as black as midnight with purple highlights that seem to absorb light around him. His unique power allows him to merge with shadows to become completely invisible, and can create darkness so deep that even dragon fire cannot penetrate it.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Shadowmaw was born from the first shadow that ever existed - the shadow cast when the very first light touched the darkness of the void. His egg formed in the deepest, darkest cave where no light had ever reached, existing in perfect darkness for millennia. When he finally hatched, the shadows themselves came alive around him, and he learned to become one with them. His scales formed from solidified darkness, absorbing all light that touches them. Shadowmaw discovered early that he could merge with shadows, becoming completely invisible and traveling through darkness. His ability to create absolute darkness makes him the lair's ultimate guardian and protector, able to hide treasures and defend against any threat that requires light to see.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Shadowmaw's natural enemies are dragons of light and fire. Radiant's brilliant light can banish his shadows, and Flamethorn's eternal flames illuminate even the darkest areas. However, they respect each other's domains and work together when needed. His relationship with Chaosflare is unique - both exist outside the normal elemental order, though in different ways. While Chaosflare brings unpredictable change, Shadowmaw brings order to darkness. Shadowmaw is closest to Crystalwing, as they both appreciate the mysteries of hidden things and work together to protect the lair's secrets. Despite his dark nature, Shadowmaw is fiercely loyal and protective, using his shadow abilities to guard the lair and his friends from threats.</p>
