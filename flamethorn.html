        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Flamethorn is a magnificent red dragon with scales that glow like embers. His wings create sparks as they beat against the air. His unique power allows him to breathe fire that never burns out, creating eternal torches that light up the darkest corners of the lair.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Flamethorn was born from the first flame that ever burned, when the primordial spark of creation first ignited. His egg appeared in the heart of an eternal volcano, bathed in fire and heat that would have destroyed any other being. When he finally hatched, flames erupted from the volcano, and his scales formed from crystallized fire that glows with inner heat. Flamethorn learned early that his fire was special - it never burns out, creating eternal torches and flames that provide light and warmth forever. His mastery over eternal fire makes him the lair's primary source of light and heat, and his flames have illuminated the darkest corners since the lair's beginning. The sparks from his wings create beautiful displays and serve as a reminder of the power of creation itself.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Flamethorn's eternal flames can conflict with Frostbite's ice, but they have learned to work together, with Flamethorn providing heat and light while Frostbite creates cooling areas. His flames can also be dangerous for Vineclaw's plants, but careful management keeps both safe. His closest friend is Metalbeak, as they both command fire and heat, working together at the forge where Flamethorn's eternal flames provide perfect, controlled heat for metalworking. Flamethorn also works closely with Shadowmaw, using his eternal light to counterbalance the shadows and create areas of warmth and illumination. Despite his fiery nature, Flamethorn is careful and controlled, using his power to help and protect rather than destroy. All dragons appreciate the warmth and light he brings to the lair.</p>
