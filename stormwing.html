        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Stormwing's scales crackle with electricity, and his eyes flash like lightning bolts during a storm. His unique power allows him to channel lightning through his wings to power crystals throughout the lair, creating a natural electrical grid.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Stormwing was born from the first bolt of lightning that ever split the sky during the world's first great storm. His egg was struck by lightning at the peak of the highest mountain, charging it with pure electrical energy for a thousand years before it finally cracked open. When he emerged, the sky itself roared with thunder, and lightning danced across his scales. His wings formed from crystallized electricity, constantly crackling with power. Stormwing learned to channel this electrical energy, discovering he could power crystals and create electrical systems throughout the lair. His mastery over lightning makes him the lair's natural power source, bringing energy and light to even the darkest corners.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Stormwing's natural enemies are dragons of earth and water. Earthheart's grounding nature can absorb his electrical energy, and Aquaris's water conducts electricity in unpredictable ways. However, they have learned to work together, with Stormwing powering the lair's systems while respecting their domains. His relationship with Breezeflight is complex - both command the sky, but in different ways. While Breezeflight prefers gentle breezes, Stormwing brings powerful storms. Despite this, they balance each other and work together to maintain the lair's atmosphere. Stormwing is closest to Metalbeak, as lightning powers the forge and helps with metalworking. His friendship with Crystalwing is also strong, as he powers the crystals she creates, making them glow with electrical energy.</p>
