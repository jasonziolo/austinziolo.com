        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crystalwing has transparent scales that refract light into beautiful colors. She sparkles like a gemstone in motion. Her unique power allows her to store memories and visions inside crystals she creates, allowing the lair to have a visual history of everything that happens.</p>

        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Crystalwing was born from the first crystal that ever formed, when light and pressure combined to create something both beautiful and functional. Her egg appeared as a massive, perfect crystal geode deep within an ancient cave, glowing with inner light for a thousand years before it split open. When she emerged, rainbows of refracted light filled the entire lair, and her scales formed from the purest, most transparent crystal. Crystalwing learned early that she could grow crystals from any surface, and discovered that these crystals could capture and store memories like living photographs. Her ability to create a visual history makes her the lair's chronicler and historian, preserving every important moment in beautiful crystalline form. The way light dances through her transparent scales creates a constantly shifting display of colors.</p>

        <h2>Enemies and Friends</h2>
        <p>Crystalwing's crystalline nature makes her vulnerable to heavy impacts, so she avoids direct conflict with heavy dragons like Earthheart, though they work together to create beautiful crystal-lined stone formations. Her closest friends are Radiant, who provides the light that makes her crystals sparkle, and Stormwing, who powers her crystals with electrical energy. Crystalwing also has a special bond with Shadowmaw, as they both appreciate the mysteries of hidden things and work together to protect the lair's secrets. Her friendship with Frostbite is strong, as both create beautiful crystalline structures - one from ice, one from crystal. Despite her delicate appearance, Crystalwing's crystals are incredibly strong, and she uses them to create both beautiful decorations and functional structures throughout the lair.</p>
